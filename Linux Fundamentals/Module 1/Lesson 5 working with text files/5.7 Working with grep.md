- **grep** is used to search text strings or regular expressions in files, or using a pipe in command output
- Is one of the most important tools in Linux 
- **grep linda \*** searches text linda in all files in the current directory
- **ps aux | grep http** uses a pipe to show all lines that contain the text "http" in the output of **ps** 
- For advances **grep** use, regular expressions can be used to match file patterns
	- **-i** ignore case 
	- **-v** show all lines that do not contain pattern
	- **-l** list filenames that contain pattern, without showing matching lines
	- **-A5** show libe that matches pattern as well as 5 lines after
	- **-B5** show line that matches pattern as well as 5 lines before
	- **-C5** combined -A5 and -B5 
	- **-R** recursively searches for pattern
