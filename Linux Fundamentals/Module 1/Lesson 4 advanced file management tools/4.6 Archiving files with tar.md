- **tar** is the Tape ARchiver and was created a long time ago
- Its basic use is to compress, extract, or list
- We use tar to create archive files
	- **tar -cvf my_archive.tar /home**
		- There are three main uses for tar cvf, c is  for create, v is for verbose and f is for the file name
		- You can use multiple files or any combination and put that in one archive altogether 
	- **tar -xvf my_archive** 
		- notice this extracts (x) to the current directory
		- use **-C** to switch the output path to make sure the contents is written in any directory 
	- **tar -tvf** will show the contents of an archive
- Add compression using **-z, -j** or **-J**
