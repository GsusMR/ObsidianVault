In Linux there's the normal user account with limited privilegies, and the root account which have access to more privilegies 

- User root is unrestricted and for that reason you should avoid working as root
- Use sudo, in order to use sudo, you need to have a user that is a member of the group "wheel" on Red Hat or sudo (Ubuntu) can use sudo to run commands with administrator privilegies 

**SU -** 
- Alternatively you can use su-, is a generic command that allows you to open a shell as another user. Asures access to the target user environment. The "-" makes sure that the new shell is started as a login shell, there you'll have access to the variables that make the user environment 
- If you use su without the "-" the your current shell is trying to open a root shell, this only works when the root user is enabled
- When su- is used with a user name as argument, a user shell is opened for that specific user account

**SUDO**
- sudo allows authorized users to run tasks with escalated privileges
- To use it, use sudo command: *sudo ls/root*
- To allow sudo usage, users must be a member of the sudo group
