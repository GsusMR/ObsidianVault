- Regular expression are text patterns that are used by tools like grep and others. These are useful in cases where you don't know exactly what you are looking for
- Always put your regex between single quotes. This is because regular expressions can use characters that can be interpreted by the shell
- Don't confuse regular expressions with globbing (shell wildcards)
- They look like file globbing, but they are not the same: 
	- **grep 'a\*' a\*** the single quotes are remarking that the first one is a regular expression
- They're used with specific tools only (grep, vim, awk, sed)
- They're confusing because basic regular expressions work with most tools 
- Extended regular expressions don't always work. Use **grep -E** if it's an extended regular expression
- Some scripting languages (like perl) come with their own regular expressions
