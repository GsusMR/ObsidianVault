- An absolute path contains the full name from the root directory to a file. for example:
	- _var/log/messages_
	- It's very clear what are you referring to
- A relative path is related to the current directory and contains the rest that is needed to get to a file. For example: 
	- _log/messages_ if current directory is set to _/var_
	- In relative paths, ".." can be used for "one directory up"
	- If the current directory is _/var/cache,../log/messages_ points to the _var/log/messages_ file
