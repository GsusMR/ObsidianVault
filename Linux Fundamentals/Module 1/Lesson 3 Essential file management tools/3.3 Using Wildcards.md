they´re also known as globbing, most file-oriented commands support using wildcards 
- _ls a*_ will show you all the files starting with an a
- _ls a?*_  will show you all the files that have a name or at least two characters
- _ls a\[nm]*_  either an n or m
- _ls a\[a-e]*_ anything between a and e
Many commands also support working with groups and ranges:
- _touch file {1...100}_ that is creating 100 files in one command
- _mkdir/data/{sales,account}_ creates two directories in one command
