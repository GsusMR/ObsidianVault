**Why are files important**
- On Linux, everything is a file
- Configuration is stored in mostly ASCII text configuration files
- Devices are addressed by using device files

- On Linux the directories are highly standardized 
	- _/usr_ is for your program files, that's where you'll find the commands that you are using in Linux environment 
	- _/var_ you'll see the different service are using to dynamically create files
	- _/etc_ contains your configuration files
	- _/proc_ shows you what the kernel is doing
- All the Linux documentation is in the Filesystem Hierarchy standard 
- Standard users have write-access to two directories only: 
	- _/home_
	- _/tmp_ temporary files

**_Use touch filename to verify write access to a location_**
